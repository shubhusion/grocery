# Grocery Store App

Welcome to the Grocery Store App! This is a modern web application that allows users to browse and purchase groceries online.

## Introduction

The Grocery Store App provides a user-friendly interface for customers and Store Manager.

Customers can perform the following actions:

1. View available grocery items in the store.
2. Add grocery items to their shopping cart.
3. Make changes to the items in their shopping cart (e.g., update quantities).
4. Proceed to checkout to complete their purchase.

Store Managers can perform the following actions:

1. Create new sections in the grocery store app.
2. Remove existing sections from the grocery store app.
3. Update the information of sections in the grocery store app.
4. Delete sections from the grocery store app.
5. Create new products and associate them with specific sections.
6. Remove existing products from the grocery store app.
7. Update the information of products in the grocery store app.
8. Delete products from the grocery store app.

The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure an interactive and responsive shopping experience for customers. It allows customers to browse and add items to their shopping cart seamlessly.

The backend of the application is powered by Python's Flask framework. It handles user authentication using the Flask-Login module, allowing customers to log in and access their personalized shopping experience. It also utilizes Flask-SQLAlchemy to create and manage the database, storing information about customers, products, and sections in the grocery store app. Store managers can access the backend to manage sections and products effectively.
